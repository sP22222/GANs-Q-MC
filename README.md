This repository contains scripts to tune GANs and price financial options using Generative Adversarial Networks integrated into a Quasi-Monte Carlo Simulation.

There are 3 scripts to train an LSTM-GAN, LSTM-TCN-GAN, and Wasserstein GAN with Gradient Penalty respectively. Starting parameters can be chosen to refine the tuning process of the GANs.

A GAN needs to be selected when pricing options using QMC.

There are several scripts available to analyse the performance of the GANs and of the GAN-QMC pricing method.
